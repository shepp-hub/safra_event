                Our tenth meeting will take place on Tuesday, April 12 2022, in the Jaglom Auditorium, Senate building, Tel Aviv University.</br>
                The talk is titled "Computational design of smart antibodies"</br>
                featuring Dr. Tzvika Hartman, SVP Computation, Biolojic Design.</br>
                Proteins are dynamic machines that can sense changes in the environment and respond to them. They can also activate other proteins or bind different targets under different conditions. However, currently, therapeutic proteins do not utilize the full potential of proteinst. Biolojic Design's computational platform designs dynamic antibodies that are programmed to respond to changes in the environment and to act differently under different biological conditions. This leads to better and safer therapies. The first such computationally designed antibody has been cleared for a phase 1/2 and will enter the clinic soon. In this talk I'll start with a brief biological background and introduce some novel smart antibodies. I will continue with a description of Biolojic’s design process, which involves both computational and wet lab work. The major part of the talk will be dedicated to the computational aspects, which aim to compute and predict antibody properties based on both public and proprietary data.
